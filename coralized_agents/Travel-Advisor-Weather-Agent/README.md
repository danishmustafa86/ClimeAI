## Setup the Agent

### 1. Clone & Install Dependencies

<details>  

```bash
# In a new terminal clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/Travel-Advisor-Weather-Agent.git

# Navigate to the project directory:
cd Travel-Advisor-Weather-Agent

# Download and run the UV installer, setting the installation directory to the current one
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | env UV_INSTALL_DIR=$(pwd) sh

# Create a virtual environment named `.venv` using UV
uv venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# install uv
pip install uv

# Install dependencies from `pyproject.toml` using `uv`:
uv sync
```

</details>

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Get the API Keys:
- [AIML API](https://aimlapi.com/) - For LLM responses
- [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) - For weather data
- [OpenCageData](https://opencagedata.com/api) - For geocoding

<details>

```bash
# Create .env file in project root
cp -r .env_sample .env

# Edit .env file with your API keys:
# AIML_API_KEY=your_aiml_api_key_here
# OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key_here
# OPENCAGE_API_KEY=your_opencage_api_key_here
# MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o-2024-08-06
```

</details>

## Run the Agent

You can run in either of the below modes to get your system running.  

- The Executable Model is part of the Coral Protocol Orchestrator which works with [Coral Studio UI](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/coral-studio).  
- The Dev Mode allows the Coral Server and all agents to be seperately running on each terminal without UI support.  

### 1. Executable Mode

Checkout: [How to Build a Multi-Agent System with Awesome Open Source Agents using Coral Protocol](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/existing-agent-sessions-tutorial-private-temp) and update the file: `coral-server/src/main/resources/application.yaml` with the details below, then run the [Coral Server](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/coral-server) and [Coral Studio UI](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/coral-studio). You do not need to set up the `.env` in the project directory for running in this mode; it will be captured through the variables below.

<details>

For Linux or MAC:

```bash

registry:
  # ... your other agents
  travel-advisor-weather-agent:
    options:
      - name: "AIML_API_KEY"
        type: "string"
        description: "API key for AIML API provider"
      - name: "OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY"
        type: "string"
        description: "API key for OpenWeatherMap weather data"
      - name: "OPENCAGE_API_KEY"
        type: "string"
        description: "API key for OpenCageData geocoding"
      - name: "MODEL_NAME"
        type: "string"
        description: "What model to use (e.g 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06')"
        default: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"

    runtime:
      type: "executable"
      command: ["bash", "-c", "<replace with path to this agent>/run_agent.sh main.py"]
      environment:
        - option: "AIML_API_KEY"
        - option: "OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY"
        - option: "OPENCAGE_API_KEY"
        - option: "MODEL_NAME"


```

For Windows, create a powershell command (run_agent.ps1) and run:

```bash
command: ["powershell","-ExecutionPolicy", "Bypass", "-File", "${PROJECT_DIR}/run_agent.ps1","main.py"]
```

</details>

### 2. Dev Mode

Ensure that the [Coral Server](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/coral-server) is running on your system and run below command in a separate terminal.

<details>

```bash
# Run the agent using `uv`:
uv run python main.py
```

You can view the agents running in Dev Mode using the [Coral Studio UI](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/coral-studio) by running it separately in a new terminal.
